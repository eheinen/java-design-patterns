# Design Pattern - Strategy (Behavioral)


### About

Source: https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy

#### Intent

 - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
 -
 Capture the abstraction in an interface, bury implementation details in derived classes.

#### Problem

 - A large monolithic design does not scale well as new graphing or monitoring requirements are levied.
